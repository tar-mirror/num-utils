num-utils - WARNING
-----------------------------------

  The num-utils are not nearly tested as much as they should be and does
not have all the functionality that you may expect it to have. I'm
releasing them now so that I can get a little bit of input from 
potential users of the programs and also so that I could reach a checkpoint
in their development.  If you have a problem with num-utils please notify
me at 'suso@suso.org' and I will take note of the bug or your comments.

  It should also be noted that options and expected behavior are likely
to change before the release of version 1.0.  Right now I'm trying to
find the best interface for these programs.

 Thanks for being patient,

 Suso Banderas
