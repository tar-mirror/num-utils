Fifth Beta Release v0.5

 - Cleaned up a few bits of code in numsum.
 - Adjusted copyright years to 2004.


 Aug. 28th, 2004 06:40 GMT
----------------------------

 - Added -c,-r,-x,-y options to numsum to allow it
 to sum columns and rows and specify which rows and columns you want.

  * Special thanks to the folks on #perl on irc.freenode.org for helping
    me out with the regex for this one.

 - Added -<n> number hack to numsum to quickly specify the column number
  that you want to sum.  For now it only does columns 1 through 9 because
  I need to figure out how to get past Getopt::Std to get the whole number
  specified.  Since this is such a hack, I might just leave it as is or drop it.
